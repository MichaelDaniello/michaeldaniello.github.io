# Lets Get It Going

I migrated my blog over from WordPress and i'm utilizing Jekyll

**Jekyll** is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))

I'll be posting all kinds of content, what i'm working on, what's on my mind, and my journey through all things tech.
