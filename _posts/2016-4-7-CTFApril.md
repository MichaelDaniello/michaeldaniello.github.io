Be sure to check out AngstromCTF this weekend. Prepare for PlaidCTF and GoogleCTF, we'll be playing both!



Some exciting things are coming up though:

**4/9  [Angstrom CTF](https://angstromctf.com/)**
-> High School CTF that I recommend people check out to get some practice in, and learn how to solve harder challenges.


**4/15-17 [PlaidCTF](http://www.plaidctf.com/)**
-> PlaidCTF is historically very good. Their infrastructure and challenges have always been very fun. It's organized by PPP. We'll be playing this.


**4/20 [BlazeCTF](http://420blaze.in/)**
-> Jeff's other CTF. FIrst place gets you geohotz's signature, wow! We might be playing this.


**4/29-5/1 [GoogleCTF](https://g.co/ctf)**
-> Google's first CTF? Some people from MITRE might be joining us to play this one. We'll be playing this.
