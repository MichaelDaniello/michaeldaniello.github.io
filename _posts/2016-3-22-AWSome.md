<div class="entry-content">
		<p>QwikLABS is celebrating 10 years of Amazon Web Services and every single lab is free. What does this mean? Lab binge time!! I'm super excited for this one and it comes in perfect timing because AWSome Boston is next week. Super focusing on skilling up as quick as possible until the 30th when this event ends. My next project will be utilizing AWS infrastructure and I can't wait to get it rolling.</p>
