title: It's CTF Time
---

<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Sunday was an absolute blast! 0ctf and sunshinectf were both going this weekend. 0ctf definitely made for more of a challenge.
		I was able to get a solve for our team 0xBU which felt great. It was a recon flag hidden in a comment which i parsed google for. 
		I tried to solve the RSA crypto challenge but ended up pulling at my hair. Next i tried to solve the Steganography challenge to no avail. The greatest thing about these events is you always learn something new: new tools, exploits, techniques, ect. Overall it was an amazing learning experience and I can't wait for the next CTF. My goal is to get two solves this time! On step at a time...</p>
