title: April CTFs
---

This month is jam packed with some awesome CTFs:

#### **4/9** - [Angstrom CTF](https://angstromctf.com/)
---
 High School CTF that I recommend people check out to get some practice in, and learn how to solve harder challenges.


#### **4/15-17** [PlaidCTF](http://www.plaidctf.com/)
---
 PlaidCTF is historically very good. Their infrastructure and challenges have always been very fun. It's organized by PPP. We'll be playing this.

#### **4/20** [BlazeCTF](http://420blaze.in/)
---
 Jeff's other CTF. FIrst place gets you geohotz's signature, wow! We might be playing this.

#### **4/29-5/1** [GoogleCTF](https://g.co/ctf)
---
 Google's first CTF? Some people from MITRE might be joining us to play this one. We'll be playing this.
 
 April has been an amazing month thus far, I look forward to absorbing as much as I can from these!
