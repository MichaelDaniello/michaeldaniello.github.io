title: PowerShell and Chef

Task automation and configuration management is the name of the game, and my tool of choice as of late is PowerShell! I've also been exploring Chef, as I believe it offers more scalability as a configuration management tool and also plays nicely with PowerShell DSC, but PowerShell is certainly nothing to scoff at! More updates will follow as I continue to explore.
