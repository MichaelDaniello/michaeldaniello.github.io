title: Tipping the Flask
---

<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Oh man Flask is so freakin fun. I have a new project i'm working on which i plan to engadge audiences with choices.
		Ultimately the audience will vote for a choice by texting the number provided on the site.
		I will be using Reveal.js which is super exciting, and the choices will be routed to Twilio SMS phone number and stored on a Redis datastructure store. As the narative progresses the choices
		will be much more intense. So far so Awesome!</p>
