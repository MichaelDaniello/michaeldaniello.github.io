When I'm searching for learning resources, it can be a very hit or miss process. Sometimes you stumble upon something great, other times you find outdated, poorly written, or otherwise irrelivant information and stumble further down the rabbit hole of technical jargon that doesn't really give you what your seeking. At times you need the indepth technical breakdown, and other times all you really want is a high level look at a concept and how it is applied in our ever evolving digital ocean.

This brings me to the point of this post. I want to provide something that I've gathered over time, and will continue to gather on my journey and learning path. As I find resources that provide a quick level up in knowledge, or something I found essential to further understanding I will be adding it to my "Learning Log". Over time it is my hope that it will save you much wasted time, and give you a map to plot your course as you proceed. 

The first of which I will be adding is a great overview on what an API is and how it works: [Introduction to APIs](https://zapier.com/learn/apis/ "Intro to APIs")
