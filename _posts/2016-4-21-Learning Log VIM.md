####Text editors: What Gives?!
It's hard to sit down and do an analysis and come out with a clear winner here. This is one of the on going wars that will never reach a final verdict. Which editor should I use? Sublime Text, Atom, VIM, EMACS?

Well my answer to this one is simple: Try them all out! Today we will be looking at a resource to learn the basics of VIM via an interesting route, an adventure game! I always have enjoyed finding ways to gamify learning, as it always tends to keep me engadged for longer periods of time and I end up with better results. So here we go, get your VIM on!
