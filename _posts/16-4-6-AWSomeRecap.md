That was AWSome! Most of the content was review for me, however there were some golden nuggets in there. Overall I had a great time at the event. The food was also excellent, and I ran into a friend of mine who coincidentally also attended. Unfortunately the free labs have ended March 31st but I will definitely be continuing to use [Qwiklabs](http://www.qwiklabs.com "QwikLabs") as time progresses.
