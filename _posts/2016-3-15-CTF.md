title: It's CTF Time
---

<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Sunday was an absolute blast! 0ctf and sunshinectf were both going this weekend. 0ctf definitely made for more of a challenge.
		I was able to get a solve for our team 0xBU which felt great. It was a recon flag hidden in a comment which i parsed google for. 
		I tried to solve the RSA crypto challenge but ended up pulling at my hair with nothing to show, but the greatest thing about these events is you always learn something new: new sec tools, exploits, techniques, ect. Overall it was an amazing learning experience and I can't wait for the next CTF.</p>
